# FastAPI Application

This is a FastAPI application designed to provide endpoints for user signup, login, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionalities.

## Installation

To install and run this application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository**: If you haven't already, clone your repository containing the FastAPI application in the server branch to your local machine 
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ayhammaster/RamadHackathon.git
    git branch --track origin server
```
then, navigate to `server/` in your terminal.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run `run.py` Script**: in the ./server 
 Open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your FastAPI application, then run the command `cd server/`, and run the following command:

    ```
    python run.py
    ```

    This command will execute the `run.py` script, which in turn will start your FastAPI application using `uvicorn` with auto-reload enabled.

    You might need to remover the host inside the `uvicorn` function in `run.py`, it's there for deployment issues.

4. **Access the Application**: Once the application is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1/:8000` in your web browser. You should see the FastAPI documentation page where you can explore and test the available endpoints.

That's it! Your FastAPI application should now be installed and running using the `python run.py` command.
