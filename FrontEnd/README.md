# Torjoman Client Side Documentation

#### Installation

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository `client branch` containing the React client side to your local machine.
``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ayhammaster/RamadHackathon.git
    git branch --track origin client
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the root directory of your React client side in the terminal then to the `client/` folder and run the following command to install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

    ``` bash
    npm install
    ```

#### Usage

1. **Development Mode**: To run the client side in development mode, use the following command:

    ``` bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the development server using Vite and allows you to view the client side in your browser. Changes to the code will trigger hot module replacement for instant updates.

2. **Build**: To build the client side for production, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command generates a production-ready build of your client side in the `dist` directory. The output will be optimized for performance and ready to be deployed to a web server.

3. **Linting**: To lint your code using ESLint, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

    This command checks your JavaScript and JSX files for syntax and style errors. It ensures that your code follows the defined coding standards and best practices.

4. **Preview**: To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

    This command serves the production build of your client side on a local server for previewing. It simulates how the client side will look and behave when deployed to a production environment.

#### Routes

The React client side uses React Router for routing. Here are the routes defined in the `App.jsx` file:

- `/`: Home page with header, hero section, form component, and footer.
- `/about-us`: About us page.
- `/chatting`: Contact page for chatting.
- `/signup`: Signup page.
- `/login`: Login page.
- `/reset-password`: Password reset page.
- `/docs`: API documentation page using Swagger UI.
- `/privacy-policy`: Privacy policy page.
- `/terms-and-conditions`: Terms and conditions page.
- `/intellectual-property`: Intellectual property page.
- `/pop`: Popup page.
- `*`: NotFound page for handling 404 errors.
- `/500`: InternalServerError page for handling 500 errors.

These routes are managed using React Router's `BrowserRouter` and `Routes` components, and each route is associated with its respective component for rendering. The client side is structured to provide a seamless user experience with clear navigation paths and error handling.
